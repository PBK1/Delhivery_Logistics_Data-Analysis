# Delhivery_Logistics_Data-Analysis
Enhancing Delhivery's Logistics Efficiency with Data Analysis
Introduction:

The project focuses on leveraging data analysis techniques to enhance the logistics efficiency of Delhivery, a prominent logistics company. By analyzing trip data and comparing actual delivery times with estimated times, the aim is to identify patterns, optimize routes, and improve resource allocation to reduce costs and enhance operational efficiency.

Key Highlights:

Dataset: Logistics data from 15,000 trips.
Tools Used: Python libraries for data cleansing, manipulation, and analysis.
Analysis Techniques: Hypothesis testing, visual analysis, and feature creation.
Focus Areas: Trip times, distances, estimated vs. actual delivery times, and route optimization.
Objective: Enhance resource allocation efficiency and reduce costs by optimizing routes and improving delivery timelines.

Project Objectives:

Data Cleansing and Manipulation: Cleanse and manipulate logistics data to ensure data quality and integrity.
Trip Analysis: Analyze trip times and distances to identify patterns and trends.
Route Optimization: Utilize hypothesis testing and visual analysis to compare actual delivery times with estimated times and identify areas for route optimization.
Feature Engineering: Extract valuable features from timestamps and addresses to enrich the dataset for further analysis.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the logistics dataset, including merging segmented trips and creating new features.
Trip Analysis: Analyze trip times and distances to uncover insights into logistics patterns.
Route Comparison: Compare actual delivery times with estimated times to identify discrepancies and potential areas for optimization.
Feature Extraction: Extract features from timestamps (e.g., month, year) and addresses (e.g., city) to enrich the dataset.
Optimization Strategies: Develop strategies for route optimization and resource allocation based on analysis findings.
Recommendations
Route Optimization: Implement route optimization strategies to reduce delivery times and costs.
Resource Allocation: Allocate resources more efficiently based on analysis insights to improve operational efficiency.
